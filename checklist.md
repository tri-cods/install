## Python/Windows

1. git bash
  - (see if it opens)
  - Comes in https://gitforwindows.org/ package
2. git version
  - `git --version`
  - 2.25.0

3. VS Code
  - `code`
  - (see if opens. If not:)
  - `code --version` to see if it is installed
4. Anaconda
  - `conda --version`
  - `python --version`
  - (As long as it is python 3, I'm not too worried about versions)
5. Jupyter Notebook
  - `jupyter notebook`
  - (see if opens)
  - If the browser opens, but fails to load, change default browser to another and try it again
6. nltk
  - Either in python shell or jupyter notebook:
  - `import nltk`
  - `nltk.download()`
  - `from nltk.book import *`
  - If library not working, try to open from the anaconda navigator
