# Open Refine

## Requirements
1. Java JRE installed

* OpenRefine requires you to have a working Java JRE, otherwise you willnot be able to start OpenRefine.(the commmand window will just open and close quickly after you double click on OpenRefine.exe)

2. Supported OS (Windows, OSX, Linux)


## Installation

**For this workshop we will be using OpenRefine 3.1 and NOT! OpenRefine 3.2 beta**

If you already have OpenRefine installed in your computer but have an older version, OpenRefine recomends that you backup your working directory (i.e. the folder in your computer where OpenRefine saves projects). If you need to backup your working directory, go [here](#backing-up)

To install OpenRefine go [here](http://openrefine.org/download.html)




If using windows: 
* click on **Windows Kit** link under OpenRefine 3.1 then download 
* unzip and extract files then double-click on openrefine.exe. (If youâ€™re having issues with the above, try double-clicking on refine.bat instead.)
* OpenRefine will open on your web browswer 

If using mac:
* click on **Mac Kit** link under OpenRefine 3.1 then download
* open the downloaded .dmg file.
* drag icon into Applications folder
* double click on the icone


For either operating system, the program might take some time to open

### Backing-up

It is possible to backup each project individually by opening the project in OpenRefine, then going to the export dropdown menu and selecting export project. 

You can also back-up your directory by making a copy of it manually. You can get to this directory from the OpenRefine start page by clicking on the Browse workspace directory link at 
the bottom left of the page.

FYI

1. If using a Mac:

* The working directory is usually located in `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRefine`

2. If using Windows, depending on the version you have, the working directory could be located in one of these directories:

* `C:\Documents and Settings\(user id)\Local Settings\Application Data\OpenRefine`
* `C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Roaming\OpenRefine`
* `C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Local\OpenRefine`
* `C:\Users\(user id)\OpenRefine`

### Possible issues when installing OpenRefine

**OpenRefine does not start after clicking the .exe, it only opens and closes a window**

Ensure that you have a Java JRE installed on your system. And have at least 1 GB of RAM available for it.
