# Python (and Anaconda)

## What it is

 [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is a distribution of Python. It provides a Python programming environment, the Jupyter notebook environment, and the conda package management system. 

## Why we use it

For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we are choosing to use and download Anaconda as it allow us to get all the required software for this institute (python, conda, and the Jupyter notebook environment) in a single download. Anaconda also includes many useful packages for machine learning, and data analysis that will be helpful should you choose to go further in your Python journey!. 

## Before we begin...

Let's check if you have Anaconda already installed on your computer.

* Try to open the Anaconda Prompt (On Mac, *Click* on the "magnifying glass" icon (also known as `Spotlight`) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar and type `Anaconda`. On Windows, press the Windows key and type Anaconda). If no option comes up, you most likely don't have it installed.

If you don't have Anaconda installed on your computer, you can follow either the macOS Catalina or Windows instructions. If you do have Anaconda and only need to update Anaconda to the newest version for this workshop, you can skip to the section that titled [Updating Anaconda (Mac or Windows)](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/di-installation-instructions/guides/python.md#updating-anaconda-mac-or-windows).

## Installation instructions: macOS Catalina 

While the installation instructions below is for macOS Catalina (10.15), this installation instruction should work for older macOS version. Older macOS versions (10.13 (High Sierra) to 10.14 (Mojave)) can also skip `Step 3` in the installation process. For older version, please check out the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#old-os). You can check your macOS version by clicking the "apple" icon on the upper-left corner of your menu bar and choose `About This Mac`. You should see the macOS name followed by the version number. Should you run into any trouble, you can also find solution to common installation issues [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/).
 
### Step 1: Download Python 3.+

Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your internet browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and click on the Python 3.+ version button. Our screenshot below shows python 3.7, but any latest **python 3.+** version will work with our instructions and the institute.

You can ignore this. Just close this screen.

You can either let your browser open with the Installer, or save it and open it yourself.

### Step 2: Run Anaconda Installer

After the download has completed, if it doesn't open automatically, double-click on the installer file you just saved on your computer. *Click* `Continue`:

![Screenshot: Anaconda installer: security image](/guides/images/anaconda02-5.png)

You should then see the initial install screen. *Click* `Continue`:

### Step 3: Run conda from your terminal

This is so that you will be able to run anaconda directly from your terminal.

Open your OS/X terminal. You can find your terminal by *clicking* the "magnifying glass" icon (also known as `Spotlight`) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar or press `Cmd + Space`, type '`Terminal` and press `Enter`. In your terminal, run the following:

```console
cd ~
bash
source .bash_profile
conda init zsh
```

### Step 4: Check if Anaconda and Python are successfully installed

Open the OS/X terminal. You can find your terminal by *clicking* the "magnifying glass" icon (also known as `Spotlight`) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar or press `Cmd + Space`, type '`Terminal` and press `Enter`. In your terminal, type `python` and press `Enter`. The terminal should print something like:

    ```python
    Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Dec  5 2017, 17:30:25) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
    ```

Type `exit()` to leave python

## Installation instructions: Microsoft Windows 10

While the installation instructions below is for Windows 10, this installation instruction should work for Windows 8 as well. For older version, please check out the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#old-os). Should you run into any trouble, you can also find solution to common installation issues [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/).

### Step 1: Download Python 3.+:

We **strongly** recommend that you follow the screens below step by step. Paying particular attention to Step 3 in the installation process.

Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your internet browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and click on the Python 3.+ version button. Our screenshot below shows python 3.7, but any latest **python 3.+** version will work with our instructions and the institute.

You can ignore this. Just close this screen and wait for your donwload to finish.

![Screenshot: Anaconda thank you for downloading](/guides/images/anaconda01w.png)

### Step 2: Run Anaconda Installer

After the download has completed, if it doesn't open automatically, double-click on the installer file you just saved on your computer. *Click* `Continue`:
 
 ![Screenshot: initial installation setup image](/guides/images/anaconda02w.png)

Accept the license by *clicking* `I Agree`:
 
![Screenshot: installation licence agreement](/guides/images/anaconda03w.png)

Install Anaconda only for yourself by choosing the just for me radio button. *Click* `Next`:

![Screenshot: radio menu, select the 1st "just me" option](/guides/images/anaconda04w.png)

Choose the location to install anaconda (the default is fine). *Click* `Next`:

### Step 3: Run Anaconda Installer Part 2: BE CAREFUL WITH THIS OPTION!

This step is so that you will be able to run anaconda directly from your terminal. 

On the Advanced Installation Options page, select **BOTH boxes**: "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" and "Register Anaconda as my default Python". Then *click* `Next`: 

![Screenshot: advanced installation options window. Has two check boxes: Add anaconda to PATH environment variables, and `Register Anaconda as my default Python`](/guides/images/anaconda06w.png)

The installation may take a while, so go grab a snack or check your email: 

When installation is completed, the window will list the location of the Anaconda installer. *Click* `Next`:

![Screenshot: Full progress bar and printed output listing location of Anaconda files](/guides/images/anaconda07w.png)

*Click* `Install Microsoft VSCode`. If it is already installed, *click* `Skip`:

## Updating Anaconda (Mac or Windows)

If you have Anaconda installed, chances are that you need to update to the most recent version. So let's go ahead and do it.

First, let's check the most recent version of Anaconda available. Go to the [Anaconda Download Page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 

Under "Download Anaconda Distribution" you should be able to see the current version.

Now it is time to check what version you have installed in your computer. Open the `Anaconda Prompt` (On Mac, open `Spotlight` (click the "magnifying glass" icon on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar) and type `Anaconda`. On Windows, press the Windows key and type Anaconda), type `conda --version` and press enter. If the output has the same version as the one on the website, you are good to go!

If you need to update your version, the easiest way is also through the Anaconda Prompt:

### Step 1: Update root version of Anaconda
* Type `conda update -n root conda` and press Enter.
* Type Y for yes and press Enter when asked.
* Wait for the process to finish. It takes some time.

### Step 2: Update all packages in Anaconda
* When the process finishes, type `conda update --all` and press Enter
* Type Y for yes and press enter when asked.
* Wait for the process to finish. This should take even longer, so go grab a cup of coffee.
* After the update is complete, type `conda --version` and press Enter. The output should be the same version as the one in the webpage.
