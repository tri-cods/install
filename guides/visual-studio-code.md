# Visual Studio Code

## What it is

A text editor is a simple notepad type application.

## Why we use it

For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use the Visual Studio Code as text editor because it supports [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting), is free and open source, and is consistent across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.

## Installation instructions

### Windows

#### Step 1: Download the file

A step should contain no more than one or two clicks/dragging files, or entering information into text boxes, unless there is, for example, a form where you may need to input multiple points of information in the same place.
