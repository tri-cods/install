# Web Scraper

## What it is?

Web Scraper offers several pieces of software and services that help users extract content from websites to be used as data. Unlike most of our other tools, it is *not* [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) though we include it because we have found it to be incredibly useful in many situations. 

We are specifically installing the Web Scraper browser plugin for Chrome or Firefox.

## Why we use it

Researchers from many disciplines have a reoccurring need: To take data -- whether links, text, images, or files -- structured on a webpage and to convert it to some other format on their own computers. Problem is all websites are slightly different and require customized scripts to get that data.

Web Scraper splits the difference between a graphical interface that requires no knowledge of programming and at the same time being flexible enough to be useful for most cases.
