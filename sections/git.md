# Git
Git is a distributed version control system used to manage changes to text files. 

# OS/X

On OS/X, git is part of the xcode command line tools. To install them:

1. Open a [terminal](osx_terminal).

2. Type the following in the terminal:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
3. [Test install](#test-install)

# Windows
As part of installing git, install the gitbash command line environment so that the command line is consistent across Windows, OSX and Linux.

1. Download git for windows:
https://git-scm.com/download/win

2. *Click* on the git installer:

7. Choose the "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" radio button and then *click* `Next`:

![three radio buttons: use git from git bash, use git from windows command prompt, use git and optional unix tools from the windows command prompt](../images/windows/git/git07.png) 

9. Choose the HTTPS transport backend (the default is fine). *Click* `Next`: 

![list of radio button optionsL 1) use the OpenSSL library, 2) use the native windows secure channel library](../images/windows/git/git08.png)

![list of radio button options: 1) checkout Windows-style, commit unix-style , 2) checkout is as is, commit is unix style, 3)checkout as is, commit is as is](../images/windows/git/git09.png)

11. On the 'configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash' window, choose the "Use Windows default console window" option:

![two radio buttons: 1) Use MinTTY, 2) use Windows default console window](../images/windows/git/git10.png)
Note: Do not choose "Use MinTTY (the default terminal of MSYS2)" as that MinTTY wil break Python.

![final installation window that says "completing the git setup wizard"](../images/windows/git/git13.png)

14. [Test install](#test-install)

## Test Install

Test that git is installed:

1. Open a [windows](windows_terminal.md) or [OS/X](osx_terminal.md) terminal. 

2. Type the following into the terminal:
```bash
 git
 ```

The terminal should print something like (note that this is truncated):

```bash
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]


```
## Updating an earlier development version of Git (that is already installed) 

Check which development version of Git is currently installed on the computer:  

1. Open a [windows](windows_terminal.md) or [OS/X](osx_terminal.md) terminal. 

2. Type the following into the terminal:
```bash 
git --version
 ```

Check for the most recent development version of Git on their website [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). As of December 2018, the most recent development version of Git is 2.19.2. 

To update a computer that already has an earlier development version: 

Open [the Git website downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) in a browser and follow the posted download instructions according to the computer type: Mac, Linux/Unix, or Windows.  

Then, check that the new development version of Git is now installed:

1. Close, and re-open a [windows](windows_terminal.md) or [OS/X](osx_terminal.md) terminal. 

2. Type the following into the terminal:
```bash 
git --version
 ```
