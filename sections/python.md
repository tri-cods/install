 [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is a distribution of Python. It provides a Python programming environment, the [Jupyter notebook environment](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/jupyter.md), and the [conda](conda.md) package management system. 

# Choose the appropriate option and follow the instructions:

## I don't know if I have Anaconda installed on my computer
* Try to open the Anaconda Prompt (On Mac, press Cmd + Space and type `Anaconda`. On Windows, press the Windows key and type Anaconda). If no option comes up, you most likely don't have it installed.

## I do have Anaconda installed on my computer
* [Updating Anaconda to the newest version](#updating-anaconda)

## I don't have Anaconda installed on my computer
* [Installation Windows](#installation-windows)
* [Installation macOS](#installation-macos)

# Updating Anaconda (Mac or Windows)

If you have Anaconda installed, chances are that you need to update to the most recent version. So let's go ahead and do it.

First, let's check the most recent version of Anaconda available. Go to the [Anaconda Download Page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 

Under "Download Anaconda Distribution" you should be able to see the current version.

Now it is time to check what version you have installed in your computer. Open the Anaconda Prompt (On Mac, press Cmd + Space and type `Anaconda`. On Windows, press the Windows key and type Anaconda), type `conda --version` and press enter. If the output has the same version as the one on the website, you are good to go!

If you need to update your version, the easiest way is also on the Anaconda Prompt:

* Type `conda update -n root conda` and press Enter.
* Type Y for yes and press Enter when asked.
* Wait for the process to finish. It takes some time.

* When the process finishes, type `conda update --all` and press Enter
* Type Y for yes and press enter when asked.
* Wait for the process to finish. This should take even longer, so go grab a cup of coffee.
* After it is finished, type `conda --version` and press Enter. The output should be the same version as the one in the webpage.
